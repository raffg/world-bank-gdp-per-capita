Regression Analysis of the Association between GDP Per Capita and Various Development Indicators

The purpose of this study was to identify the best predictors of a countryâ€™s GDP per capita from
multiple indicators common to development goals, that is, fixed broadband subscription rate,
access to improved water sources, internet user rate, mortality rate for under 5-year olds,
proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments, rural population rate, urban
population rate, and the birth rate.

I spent spent my career living in developing countries while working for an international aid
agency. By investigating which development goals most effectively lead to increases in GDP per
capita, all aid agencies globally will be better able to focus their activities towards improvement
of those indicators, which will indirectly lead to increased incomes for families.

I have witnessed firsthand how a small income boost to impoverished communities can lead
dramatic improvement in quality of life in those communities. By focusing development efforts
on improving the indicators which are most closely correlated to GDP per capita, aid agencies
can have the greatest impact towards their end goals.
